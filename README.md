This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: the improper handling of zero values in division operations. The file `bug.js` contains the erroneous code that returns 0 when either input is zero, rather than addressing the potential for division by zero. The corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.js`, showing how to appropriately manage zero values to prevent unexpected behavior. This is a crucial aspect of defensive programming in JavaScript.
